Hello everyone and welcome to my week 3 blog post for senior design

This week I will be talking about terraform, a scalable automation tool that also works for cloud services such as AWS! Terraform is an automation tool that is used to modify existing infrastructure assets in the cloud, or create new infrastructure assets. It is very useful because it can be used to rapidly deploy an entire company's infrastructure in a fraction of the time it would take one to do it manually. All one has to do is write out the code in order to deploy the infrastructure that they want. In the case of AWS at least, it is possible to write code that is specific to the exact spec of infrastructure elements that you want. In this sense, it can made as a template and used anywhere.

Terraform is based off of JSON, and can be used to specify the elements of the infrastructure that you want to deploy. When installed as a package on something such as linux, it is very easy to use, as it comes included with a context and syntax checker to make sure that what you want to deploy is a valid system. Once this infrastructure is deployed, Terraform can be used to also manage this system, so that one does not have to go in and manually make any changes. This IT automation tool makes the life of any developer or IT Operations professional significantly easier with its automated nature.
